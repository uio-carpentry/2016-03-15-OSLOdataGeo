<li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
<br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have 
Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set! 
<br>
If you need a spreadsheet 
program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install 
instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.
       <ul>
          <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
        <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation page</a>. The version for Linux 
should automatically be selected. Click <b>Download Version 4.4.2</b>. You 
will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
Your download should begin automatically. 
          <li><b>Install LibreOffice</b>
            <br>Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.
<li>To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>R</b>
<br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the 
programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
<ul>
<li>R is available through most Linux package managers. 
You can download the binary files for your distribution
        from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. Or
        you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu
        run <code>sudo apt-get install r-base</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install R</code>). 
<li>To install RStudi, go to the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio Download page</a>
<li>Under <i>Installers</i> select the version for your distribution.
<li>Once it's downloaded, double click the file to install it
<li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
</ul>
